## What is <img src="media/quarto.png" alt="A blue circle divided into four quadrants, followed by the name &apos;quarto&apos;." style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 0px; width:110px;height:30px;"/> ?

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a publishing system built on Pandoc that allows users to create dynamic content using R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS (with plans to add more languages too!).

R users have long loved [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for combining prose, code, and outputs into single "knitted" documents. Quarto extends all of RMarkdown's best features (plus many more!) to additional languages.

You can explore [Quarto's documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/guide/) to learn more about creating documents, websites, blogs, books, slides, etc.

::: callout-note
## Fun fact!

This instructional document was built using Quarto!
:::

## Do I need to use Quarto to build my website?

Nope! There are a number of R-based tools that make building websites and blogs fun and easy, including the still-widely-used [`{blogdown}`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/) and [`{distill}`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html) packages.

Though still relatively new, Quarto has the data science community (particularly on Twitter) abuzz -- it's versatile, user-friendly, and looks great out-of-the-box.

::: callout-note
## Twitter is a great place to stay atop Quarto (and all-things [#rstats](https://twitter.com/search?q=%23rstats&src=typed_query)) news.

:::

## I. Create the scaffolding for your website

::: callout-important
## Before getting started:

Be sure to have R/RStudio ([RStudio v2022.02](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/) or later) and [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) installed on your computer.
:::

We'll review two ways to get started with building your website.

a.  Through the command line
b.  Using the RStudio IDE

The order of operations is slightly different depending on which approach you decide to take, but the concepts remain the same.

::: panel-tabset
## **a. Through the command line**

**Why use the command line to set up your Quarto website?**

-   You'll start to get more comfortable working in a command line interface (CLI)

-   You're able to interact with Quarto via the command line regardless of which language or IDE you might find yourself working with (R, Python, Julia, ObservableJS)

::: callout-important
## Prerequisite:

In order to interact with GitHub from the command line, you'll need to install GitHub CLI first. You can do so in your terminal by running `brew install gh` or download and install from the [GitHub CLI website](https://cli.github.com/).
:::

**Steps:**

1.  Open up a terminal (Mac) or git bash (Windows) window.

2.  Determine where you are in your file system using the `pwd` (print working directory). Use `cd` (change directory) to navigate your file system to whatever directory you'd like your quarto project to live.

::: callout-tip
To stay organized, I save all my git repositories to a folder called `git` in my computer's home directory (e.g. `Users/samanthacsik/git/`).
:::

3.  Use the following commands to create a quarto project directory that contains the files necessary for building your website:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
quarto create-project mysite --type website
```

**Recommended:** Name the project **yourusername.github.io** if you want that to be the site name (this is a "freebie" in GitHub). Otherwise, name it something reasonable (this will become the slug for your site if publishing with GitHub pages, so choose carefully). I'm calling my project **mysite** just for tutorial purposes only -- you should definitely give yours a more practical/creative name.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page
#| fig-subcap: 
#|  - "Use `pwd` to see your current working directory. Use `cd` to change directories."
#|  - "Create a new quarto project using the `quarto create-project your_project_name --type website` commands."
knitr::include_graphics("media/pwd_cd.png")
knitr::include_graphics("media/CLI_create_website.png")
```

You should now see a folder called `mysite` (or whatever you named your Quarto project) with a series of files (`_quarto.yml`, `about.qmd`, `index.qmd`, `styles.css`) that provide the scaffolding for your website.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("media/mysite_finder.png")
```

4.  You can preview your very basic, but functional website straight from the terminal by typing:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
quarto preview mysite
```

Your site preview should open up in your browser. Quit your preview by pressing `control` + `C`

5.  At this point you've created a directory (folder) but it's not yet being tracked by git. First be sure to `cd` into your website folder. Then, initialize this folder as a git repository using the `git init` command in the terminal window.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git init
```

6.Next, we'll switch the branch name from `master` to `main`. *Why? The racist "master" terminology for git branches motivates us to update our default branch to "main" instead.* **Note:** If you create a repo in GitHub FIRST, the default now has been updated to make the default branch 'main'. However, you'll need to update the branch name if you create a local git repository first (like we've just done). Update the branch name from `master` to `main` by running the following line in the terminal window:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

You can double check that this worked by typing out the `git status` command, which displays the state of the working directory and the staging area (this is a command I find myself using often when working on the command line!). You should see something that looks like this:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
(base) Samanthas-MacBook-Air:mysite samanthacsik$ git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.quarto/
	_quarto.yml
	_site/
	about.qmd
	index.qmd
	styles.css

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

7.  `add` (analogous to checking the boxes next to your files in the RStudio Git tab) the files in your `mysite` directory...

```{bash}
#| eval: false
# this adds all untracked or changed files at once
git add . 

# alternatively, you can add files individually
git add <file_name>
```

::: callout-tip
Use the `git status` command again to see if your files have been successfully added *before* committing them.
:::

...and commit them:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git commit -m "your descriptive commit message here"
```

8.  Create a repository for your project on GitHub using the subcommand:

::: column-margin
**Git vs. Github:** [*Git*](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that allows you to manage and track your file version control history while [*GitHub*](https://github.com/) is a cloud-based hosting service that allows you to manage Git repositories. As Jenny Bryan describes in her book [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html), hosting services like GitHub *"provide a home for your Git-based projects on the internet."* These services not only help to facilitate collaboration, but they also protect you in the event your computer suddenly dies -- just "clone" your GitHub repository back onto your new computer and voila! you're able to pick right back up where you left off.
:::

```{bash}
#| eval: false
gh repo create
```

When prompted, select **Push an existing local repository to GitHub**, then enter the desired name of your repository.

TO BE CONTINUED....
:::

## **b. Using the RStudio IDE**

**Why use RStudio to set up your Quarto website?**

-   It's *super* easy to do with the click of just a few buttons! **Remember**, the commands we type out in our terminal window underlie the buttons we're clicking on in the RStudio IDE! RStudio simply provides a user-friendly interface for executing those commands.

**Steps:**

1.  Open up RStudio and click on the ![A blue cube symbol with 'R' in the center is on the left. To the right are the words 'Project: (None)' in white, with a downward facing arrow, signifying a drop down menu](media/project.png){alt="A blue cube symbol with 'R' in the center is on the left. To the right are the words 'Project: (None)' in white, with a downward facing arrow, signifying a drop down menu" style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 0px; width:80px;height:18px;"} button in the top right corner. Select **New Project...**

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("media/vRStudio1.png")
```

2.  Click on **New Directory**, then **Quarto Website**

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page
knitr::include_graphics("media/vRStudio2.png")
knitr::include_graphics("media/vRStudio3.png")
```

3.  Fill out the **Directory name:** field (this is the name of your R project, and eventually, your GitHub repo name), choose where to save your directory using the **Browse** button. Click **Create Project**.

**Recommended:** Name the project **yourusername.github.io** if you want that to be the site name (this is a "freebie" in GitHub). Otherwise, name it something reasonable (this will become the slug for your site if publishing with GitHub pages, so choose carefully). I'm calling my project **mysite** just for tutorial purposes only -- you should definitely give yours a more practical/creative name.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("media/vRStudio4.png")
```

You should now see a folder called `mysite` (or whatever you named your Quarto project) with a series of files (`_quarto.yml`, `about.qmd`, `index.qmd`, `styles.css`) that provide the scaffolding for your website in the **Files** tab (in the bottom right panel in RStudio, if you haven't altered the pane layout).

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
# knitr::include_graphics("media/mysite_scaffolding.png")
```

4.  At this point you've created a directory (folder) with the website scaffolding files, but it's not yet being tracked by git, nor is it connected to a remote repository on GitHub. To start setting this up, first install the [`{usethis}`](https://usethis.r-lib.org/index.html) package if you don't already have it.

```{r}
#| eval: false
install.packages("usethis")
```

5.  In the Console (while in your website project in RStudio), run `usethis::use_git()` to create a local git repo. Choose yes when asked if it's okay to commit any uncommitted files. If asked to restart R, choose yes. Once complete, you should see the **Git** tab appear in your top left pane in RStudio.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("media/mysite_scaffolding_git.png")
```

::: callout-note
We're using the `usethis` workflow here because it's a super useful package to begin learning for project setup. However, rather than using the `usethis::use_git()` function here to create your local git repo, you could have also checked the box where it says **Create a git repository** when initially setting up your Quarto website (see step 3 above).
:::

6.  Then, in the Console, run `usethis::use_github()` to create an upstream remote repo. Your web browser should open up to your new GitHub repository, with the same name as your local git repo/R project.

::: column-margin
**Git vs. Github:** [*Git*](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that allows you to manage and track your file version control history while [*GitHub*](https://github.com/) is a cloud-based hosting service that allows you to manage Git repositories. As Jenny Bryan describes in her book [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html), hosting services like GitHub *"provide a home for your Git-based projects on the internet."* These services not only help to facilitate collaboration, but they also protect you in the event your computer suddenly dies -- just "clone" your GitHub repository back onto your new computer and voila! you're able to pick right back up where you left off.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-cap: "After running `usethis::use_github()` your browser window should open up to your new GitHub repository and look similar to the browswer above."
knitr::include_graphics("media/mysite_remote.png")
```

7.  Next, let's check the name of our default branch -- that is, the branch that all changes eventually get merged back into (if you're building a website, this branch is typically the one you'll want to deploy). There are two ways to check this:

    a.  open your Terminal window from RStudio and type `git status` -- the first printed line should say **On branch \_\_\_**.

    b.  click on the **Git** tab in the top right pane of RStudio. Next to the ![A white diamond with two purple squares, one directly above and one directly to the right, connected to the diamond by a line.](media/branch.png){alt="A white diamond with two purple squares, one directly above and one directly to the right, connected to the diamond by a line." style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 0px; width:20px;height:18px;"} symbol, you should see a dropdown menu that displays the name of your current branch.

    **If your current branch is named *master*, follow steps 8-12 below. If your branch is named *main*, you're good to go! You can continue to part *II. Publish your site with GitHub Pages*.**

8.  The next few steps will walk through how to switch the default branch name from `master` to `main`. Why? The racist "master" terminology for git branches motivates us to update our default branch to "main" instead. *Note: Git/GitHub/R tools are in the process of migrating away from `master`. If you create a repo in GitHub FIRST, the default branch is now `main`. However, the `usethis::use_github()` method for creating a repo hasn't yet been updated, so we'll do it manually.* In RStudio, click on the branch button in the Git tab (the diamond with purple rectangle "branches"):

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("media/branch_button.png")
```

9.  In the new window, enter the new branch name "main". Make sure that **Sync branch with remote** IS CHECKED. Then click "Create."

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("media/new_branch.png")
```

10. Head back to your GitHub repo, refresh, then click where it now says **2 branches**:

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("media/two_branches.png")
```

11. Click on the "switchy arrows" in the top right of the panel that says "Default branch" (if you hover, the tooltip says "switch default branch"). Click on those arrows to update the default branch to 'main'.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page
knitr::include_graphics("media/default_branch.png")
knitr::include_graphics("media/switch_main.png")
```

12. Once you've updated the default to main, delete the `master` branch. Cool. Now you're working just on main.
:::

## II. Publish your site with GitHub Pages

There are a [lots of options to publish your website](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/publishing-websites.html). We'll use the [GitHub Pages option](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/publishing-websites.html#github-pages), which allows you to publish a website from any GitHub repository. To do so, there are a few configuration steps:

1.  Create a file named `.nojekyll` in your repository, which is required to disable some processing of HTML files that GitHub does by default. Do this from your terminal (you can use the terminal tab in RStudio or a separate terminal window -- just make sure you're in the correct directory) using the following command:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
touch .nojekyll
```

::: callout-note
The `touch` command creates a new, empty file.
:::

::: callout-note
You're creating a *hidden* file, which won't visibly appear in your directory. You *should* see it show up as a file to track with git under the **Git** tab in RStudio. You can also view hidden files in Finder (Mac) using the keyboard shortcut `Command` + `Shift` + `.`, or follow [these instructions](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/show-hidden-files-0320fe58-0117-fd59-6851-9b7f9840fdb2) for Windows 10, 8.1, and 7.
:::

2.  Set the `output-dir` in your `_quarto.yml` file to "docs":

```{r}
#| eval: false
project:
  type: website
  output-dir: docs
```

3.  Build your site by clicking on the **Build** tab, then **Render Website.** You should see a minimal, albeit functional, soon-to-be website appear in the RStudio **Viewer** tab. Click on the <img src="media/view_in_browser.png" alt="A browser window overlaid by an arrow pointing up and angled to the right." style="display: inline-block; margin: 0; position: relative; top: 0px; width:25px;height:20px;"/> button to open your file in your web browser. **Note:** your website is currently being hosted by your local machine, not at a shareable URL. We'll get there soon though!

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("media/build_site.png")
```

4.  Now we need to send all of our files in our local git repository to our remote GitHub repository:

    a.  **Stage** your files by checking the boxes in the **Git** tab (this is analogous to the `git add .` command used in the terminal for staging all files)
    b.  **Commit** your files by clicking the Commit button, adding a commit message, and clicking "Commit" (analogous to `git commit -m "my commit message"`)
    c.  **Push** your files to the remote repository (on GitHub) by clicking the "Push" button with the green upward facing arrow (analogous to `git push`).

5.  Configure GitHub pages to serve content from the "docs" directory by clicking on the **Settings** tab in the top menu bar, then **Pages** tab from the left hand menu bar. Make sure that Branch is set to `main` and that the selected folder is set to `/docs`. Click "Save". Your website's URL will appear inside a blue banner at the top of the page. Give it a few minutes to render (you'll get a 404 error message if it's not ready yet), then explore your site!

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page
#| fig-subcap: 
#|  - "Your website's URL will appear at the top of the page once you've configured GitHub pages to host your Quarto site"
#|  - "A hosted Quarto website! Now time to add customize and add content."
knitr::include_graphics("media/gh_pages.png")
knitr::include_graphics("media/rendered_site.png")
```

## III. Where you should start changing stuff

Right now, our website is built using Quarto default styling. Let's learn about where things live and how to start customizing some stuff.

1.  **Don't mess with stuff in `/docs`.** When you Render your site (by clicking Build \> Render Website), Quarto takes all your `.qmd` files, converts them to `.html` files (along with some other important stuff) and saves everything to your `/docs` folder. Your site now deploys from this folder, so you really don't want to mess with anything in here directly.

2.  **Edit your landing page (`index.html`). Give your landing/home page a makeover by trying out some of the following:

    -   Update the yaml `title` in your `index.html` file. Here, I changed mine from "mysite" to my name, "Samantha Csik"

    -   Delete the sample text and code and begin adding your own content.

3.  **Turn your landing page (`index.html`) into an "[About Page](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html)" with a photo**. When the `about` option is added to a document's yaml, a special template will be used to layout the content of that page. Choose from one of Quarto's five [built-in templates](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/website-about.html#templates), each with a slightly different layout style. Some yaml options to play around with:

    -   `template`: choose from Quarto's built-in template options

    -   `image` (*note that this is a document-level option*): supply it the file path to your photo

    -   `image-width` & `image-shape`: adjust your image's size and shape (`round`, `rounded`, `rectangle`)

    -   `links`: add buttons with links to your social media pages

```
title: "Samantha Csik"
    image: headshot.jpg
    about: 
      template: trestles
      image-shape: rounded
      image-width: 15em
      links:
        - text: LinkedIn
          href: https://www.linkedin.com/in/samanthacsik/
        - text: Twitter

        - text: Email
          href: mailto:scsik@ucsb.edu
```

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
knitr::include_graphics("media/about_page.png")
```

4.  **Add additional pages to your website.** In the default Quarto website skeleton, there are two items in the navbar that appear as "Home" and "About". Those navbar tabs link to two `.html` files (`index.html` and `about.html`) and are automatically rendered when when you Build to `/docs` (i.e. you don't need to knit them manually to create the html). Adding a new page to your website requires two steps:

    a\. **Create a new `.qmd` file** (New File \> Quarto Document and save it to your project's root directory) and add any content that you want to appear on that page. Here, I'm creating a new page called "All of my favorite resources!" and saved it to my root directory as `resources.qmd`.

    b\. **Update `_quarto.yml`**

5.  

6.  ***Each nav bar page should be its own `.qmd` file.***
