**Presenter:** Sam Csik

**Duration:** 1 hour

A personal website is not only a great way to showcase your experiences and skills, but also gives people (potential employers included!) a better sense of who you are as a person. There are lots of great ways to build websites using R (e.g. [`{distill}`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html), [`{blogdown}`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)) -- this year, we'll be using [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), an exciting, new, and versatile publishing tool that supports R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS.

Instructions for gettings started can be found in [this Quarto document](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/).

Some content was adapted from Allison Horst's [instructions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0SZiVvp32UTJ9sK_yVjI8ou6pVdFRXsY2236tiTA1c/edit) for building a `distill` website, taught in Summer 2021.
