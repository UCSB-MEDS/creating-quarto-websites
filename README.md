# Building your personal website using Quarto

Step-by-step instructions for building a personal website using Quarto and deploying it using GitHub Pages.

## Description 

A personal website is not only a great way to showcase your experiences and skills, but also gives people (potential employers included!) a better sense of who you are as a person. There are lots of great ways to build websites using R (e.g. [`{distill}`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html), [`{blogdown}`](https://bookdown.org/yihui/blogdown/)). In this workshop, we'll use [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/), a user-friendly and versatile publishing frameowrk that supports R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS. Instructions for getting started can be found in [this Quarto document](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/creating-quarto-websites/).
