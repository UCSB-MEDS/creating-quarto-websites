## {{< fa seedling title="Sprouted seedling" >}} Create the scaffolding for your website {#create-website-scaffolding}

::: callout-important
## Before getting started...

To follow along, you'll need:

-   [R](https://cloud.r-project.org/) & [RStudio](https://posit.co/download/rstudio-desktop/#download) installed 
-   [Quarto](https://quarto.org/docs/get-started/) installed -- **Quarto is now included with RStudio v2022.07.1+ i.e. no need for a separate download/install if you have the latest version of RStudio**
-   A [GitHub](https://github.com/) account
-   [Git](https://git-scm.com/) installed / configured

Please refer to the [MEDS Installation Guide](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/MEDS-installation-guide/) for detailed setup instructions (follow steps 1-7).

This document reviews two ways to get started with using Quarto to build your website.

(1) `r fontawesome::fa("r-project", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` Using the RStudio IDE
(2) `r fontawesome::fa("terminal", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` Through the command line\

The order of operations is slightly different depending on which approach you decide to take, but the concepts remain the same.
