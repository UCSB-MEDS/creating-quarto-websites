## {{< fa circle-question title="Question mark" >}} What is Quarto? {#what-is-quarto}

[Quarto](https://quarto.org/) is a publishing system built on [Pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) that allows users to create dynamic content using R, Python, Julia, and ObservableJS (with plans to add more languages too!).

R users have long loved [RMarkdown](https://rmarkdown.rstudio.com/) for combining prose, code, and outputs into single "knitted" documents. Quarto extends all of RMarkdown's best features (plus many more!) to additional languages.

## A side-by-side comparison of `.rmd` vs. `.qmd` files
If you're already an avid RMarkdown user, great news! RMarkdown (`.rmd`) and Quarto Markdown (`.qmd`) files look super similar:

-  document-level metadata and configurations are included in the document's YAML (denoted by the `---` gates at the top of the document)
-  code is written inside executable code chunks
-  prose is written in the body of the document
  
There are some slight differences to be aware of:

-  some YAML option names differ between the two document types (e.g. `output` in `.rmd` vs. `format` in `.qmd`)
-  chunk-level execution options are are written within with code block braces (e.g. ````{r echo=FALSE}`) in `.rmd` files, and written below code block braces following hash pipes, `|#` (e.g. `|# echo: false`) in `.qmd` files
-  booleans are capitalized in YAML and chunk-level metadata in `.rmd` files (e.g. `FALSE`) and lowercase in `.qmd` files (e.g. `false`)
- you **Knit** `.rmd` files and **Render** `.qmd` files to convert your work to your desired output type (e.g. `.html`)

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("media/rmd-vs-qmd.png")
```

They also look pretty similar when knitted/rendered. Below is a side-by-side comparison of a knitted `.rmd` file and a rendered `.qmd` file (both as `.html` files):

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("media/rmd-vs-qmd-output.png")
```
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: center
#| fig-alt: "A schematic representing the multi-language input (e.g. Python, R, Observable, Julia) and multi-format output (e.g. PDF, html, Word documents, and more) versatility of Quarto."
knitr::include_graphics("media/quarto_schematic.png")
