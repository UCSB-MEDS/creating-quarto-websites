## Organizing projects / git repositories
There are lots of differing opinions on how to keep your projects / git repositories organized on your computer. I personally save all of mine to a folder called `git` (`repos` is another great name) in my computer's home directory (e.g. on my Mac, `Users/samanthacsik/git/`) so everything is in one place.
