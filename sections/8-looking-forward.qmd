## {{< fa forward title="Fast forward symbol" >}} Looking forward {#looking-forward}

You should now have a basic version of your website up and running ðŸŽ‰ During Fall quarter, we'll learn how to:

a\. [customize the appearance of our site using Sass & CSS](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/customizing-quarto-websites/#/title-slide)

b\. [add a blog and blog posts to our websites](https://samanthacsik.github.io/posts/2022-10-24-quarto-blogs/) 

c\. continue developing your online "brand"

In the meantime, explore some [current student & alumni websites](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/student_websites.html) (**Note:** MEDS class of 2022 used the [`{distill}`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html) package to build their websites) for inspiration, or dig into the [Quarto Website documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) if you're hoping to get started now on further customization.
