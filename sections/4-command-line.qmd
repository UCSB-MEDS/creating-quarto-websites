### **Why use the command line to set up your Quarto website?**

-   You'll start to get more comfortable working in a command line interface (CLI)

-   You're able to interact with Quarto via the command line regardless of which language (R, Python, Julia, ObservableJS) or IDE (**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment) you might find yourself working with

### **Steps:**

1.  Open up your terminal.

2.  Determine where you are in your file system using `pwd` (print working directory). Use `cd` (change directory) to navigate your file system to wherever you'd like your project to live.

::: callout-tip
There are lots of differing opinions on how to keep your R projects/git repositories organized on your computer. I personally save all of mine to a folder called `git` in my computer's home directory (e.g. `Users/samanthacsik/git/`) so everything is in one place.
:::

3.  Use the following commands to create a quarto website project directory that contains the files necessary for building your website:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
quarto create-project mysite --type website 
```

::: column-margin
Throughout this document, we'll use the words **directory** and **folder** interchangeably.
:::

-   **Recommended:** Because we'll be using GitHub pages to publish/host our websites, it's recommended that you name your project **yourusername.github.io** (you're allowed **one** user website with the **github.io** suffix) -- for example, my personal website that is hosted via GitHub pages is named **samanthacsik.github.io**. Otherwise, name it something reasonable (this will become the [slug](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Slug) for your site if publishing with GitHub pages, so choose carefully). I'm calling my project **mysite** *just for tutorial purposes only* -- you should definitely give yours a more practical/creative name.

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page
#| fig-subcap: 
#|  - "Use `pwd` to see your current working directory. Use `cd` to change directories."
#|  - "Create a new quarto project using the `quarto create-project your_project_name --type website` commands."
knitr::include_graphics("media/pwd_cd.png")
knitr::include_graphics("media/CLI_create_website.png")
```

-   If you `cd` into your new `mysite` directory (or whatever you named your quarto project), and use the `ls` command to list out all the contents of that directory, you should see a series of files (`_quarto.yml`, `about.qmd`, `index.qmd`, `styles.css`) that provide the scaffolding for your website. For example:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
# print current working directory
(base) Samanthas-MacBook-Air:git samanthacsik$ pwd 
/Users/samanthacsik/git

# move into `mysite` directory
(base) Samanthas-MacBook-Air:git samanthacsik$ cd mysite/ 
(base) Samanthas-MacBook-Air:mysite samanthacsik$ 

# list out all files in the `mysite` directory
(base) Samanthas-MacBook-Air:mysite samanthacsik$ ls
_quarto.yml	_site		about.qmd   index.qmd   styles.css
```

-   Alternatively, you can use Finder (Mac) or Windows Explorer (Windows) to view your new directory and files.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("media/mysite_finder.png")
```

4.  You can preview your very basic, but functional website straight from the terminal by typing:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
quarto preview mysite
```

-   Your site preview should open up in your browser. Quit your preview by pressing `control` + `C`

::: callout-important
You will need to supply the path to your website directory when previewing from a different location. For example, if my Quarto website directory is at `User/samanthacsik/git/mysite`, but I am one directory above in `User/samanthacsik/git`, I can run `quarto preview mysite`. Alternatively I could provide the full path `quarto preview User/samanthacsik/git/mysite` or relative path quarto preview `~/git/mysite`, no matter which directory I am currently in.
:::

5.  At this point you've created a directory (folder) but it's not yet being tracked by git. First be sure to `cd` into your website folder. Then, initialize this folder as a git repository using the `git init` command in the terminal window.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git init
```

::: column-margin
`git status` is a super useful command which displays the state of your working directory and staging area. I use this command *often* when working on the command line to double check that I'm actually where I think I am, and to see tracked files and untracked or changed files. It's a good habit run `git status` after switching branches or before/after adding files to commit.
:::

6.  Next, let's check the name of our default branch -- that is, the branch that all changes eventually get merged back into (if you're building a website, this branch is typically the one you'll want to deploy). In your Terminal window, type `git status`. You should see something that looks like this, where the first line tells you which branch you're currently on:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
(base) Samanthas-MacBook-Air:mysite samanthacsik$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.quarto/
	_quarto.yml
	_site/
	about.qmd
	index.qmd
	styles.css

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

-   **If your current branch is named `master`, follow step 7 below to update the name to `main`.** Why? The racist "master" terminology for git branches motivates us to update our default branch to "main" instead. If your branch is already named `main`, you can head straight to step 8.

::: column-margin
**Note:** If you create a repo in *GitHub first*, the default now has been updated to make the default branch `main`. However, if you create a *local git repository first* (as we've done here) you may need to update your default branch name to `main` (depending on your version of Git and its configuration settings).
:::

7.  Let's switch our default branch name from `master` to `main`. Choose your workflow below based on your Git version (check your version by running `git --version` in your Terminal):

::: panel-tabset
## **`r fontawesome::fa("git-alt", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` For Git version 2.28 or later**

You can update the default branch to `main` by running the following line in the Terminal window:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

***This sets the default branch name to `main` for any new repositories you create moving forward (it does not rename branches in existing projects).***

You can double check that this worked by typing out the `git status` command again. The first printed line should now read, `On branch main`.

::: callout-important
Be mindful that your workflow for updating `master` to `main` will look different if you've already created both a local git repo (first) AND an upstream remote i.e. GitHub repo (second). Check out [this post](https://gitbetter.substack.com/p/how-to-change-git-default-branch) for more info.
:::

## **`r fontawesome::fa("git-alt", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` For older versions of Git**

Rename the default branch as `main` by running the following line in the Terminal window:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git branch -m master main
```

The `-m` attribute is used to rename the branch without affecting the branch's history.

***This sets the default branch name to `main` ONLY for this repository (so you'll need to do this with any new local git repositories that you create.***

You can double check that this worked by typing out the `git status` command again. The first printed line should now read, `On branch main`.

:::

8.  Add the files in your `mysite` directory (*analogous to checking the boxes next to your files in the RStudio Git tab*)...

```{bash}
#| eval: false
# this adds all untracked or changed files at once
git add . 

# alternatively, you can add files individually
git add <file_name>
```

::: callout-tip
Use the `git status` command again to see if your files have been successfully added *before* committing them -- any untracked or changed files that were once printed in **red** should now appear in **green**.
:::

...and commit them (*analogous to pressing the "Commit" button in RStudio and typing your commit message into the popup window*):

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

9.  At this point, you've created a local Git repository that contains the basic files needed to build your Quarto website. Now, we need to create a "remote" repository (i.e. a version of your project that is hosted on the Internet) on GitHub. There are multiple ways to do this, but we'll cover the workflow that makes most intuitive sense to me. Open up/log in to [GitHub](https://github.com/) and [create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository).

::: column-margin
**Git vs. Github:** [*Git*](https://git-scm.com/) is a version control system that allows you to manage and track your file version control history while [*GitHub*](https://github.com/) is a cloud-based hosting service that allows you to manage Git repositories. As Jenny Bryan describes in her book [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html), hosting services like GitHub *"provide a home for your Git-based projects on the internet."* These services not only help to facilitate collaboration, but they also protect you in the event your computer suddenly dies -- just "clone" your GitHub repository back onto your new computer and voila! You're able to pick right back up where you left off.
:::

::: callout-important
## Do not initialize with a README, license, or `.gitignore` files!

Avoid doing this when you create your new GitHub repo to avoid errors. You can add these after your project as been pushed.
:::

10. Copy the remote repository URL (found at the top of the Quick Setup Page) to your clipboard.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("media/GH_quick_setup.png")
```

11. In Terminal, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
# set the new remote using your GitHub repo URL
git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL>

# verify the new remote URL is correct (this just prints out the URL you added)
git remote -v
```

12. Push the changes in your local repository to your remote repository on GitHub:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git push -u origin main
```

-   You should see something similar to this print out, if successful!

```{bash}
#| eval: false
(base) Samanthas-MacBook-Air:mysite samanthacsik$ git push -u origin main
