### **Why use the command line to set up your Quarto website?**

-   You'll start to get more comfortable working in a command line interface (CLI)

-   You're able to interact with Quarto via the command line regardless of which language (R, Python, Julia, ObservableJS) or IDE (**I**ntegrated **D**evelopment **E**nvironment) you might find yourself working with

### **Steps:**

1.  **Open up your command line interface** (often Terminal on Macs or Git Bash on Windows)

2.  **Navigate to the location on your computer where you'd like your project to live.** Determine where you are in your file system using `pwd` (print working directory). Use `cd` (change directory) to navigate your file system to wherever you'd like your project to live.

## Organizing R projects / git repositories
There are lots of differing opinions on how to keep your R projects/git repositories organized on your computer. I personally save all of mine to a folder called `git` in my computer's home directory (e.g. `Users/samanthacsik/git/`) so everything is in one place.
:::

3.  **Create the scaffolding (i.e. folder structure & necessary files) for your website** by running the following in the command line (substitute `mysite` with whatever name you want to give your repo):

::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
## Data science jargon: Directory == Folder
Throughout this document, we'll use the words **directory** and **folder** interchangeably.
:::

```{bash}
#| eval: false
quarto create-project mysite --type website 
```

::: {.callout-important}
## Name your project **username.github.io** if you plan to deploy using GitHub pages
Because we'll be using GitHub pages to publish/host our websites, it's recommended that you name your project **username.github.io** (you're allowed **one** user website with the **github.io** suffix) -- for example, [the project/GitHub repository](https://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io), which contains the code for [my personal website](https://samanthacsik.github.io/), is named **samanthacsik.github.io**. Otherwise, name it something reasonable (this will become the [slug](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Slug) for your site if publishing with GitHub pages, so choose carefully). I'm calling my project **mysite** *just for tutorial purposes only* -- you should definitely give yours a more practical/creative name.
:::

```{r}
#| echo: false
#| layout-ncol: 2
#| column: page
#| fig-subcap: 
#|  - "Use `pwd` to see your current working directory. Use `cd` to change directories."
#|  - "Create a new quarto project using the `quarto create-project your_project_name --type website` commands."
knitr::include_graphics("media/pwd_cd.png")
knitr::include_graphics("media/CLI_create_website.png")
```

-   If you `cd` into your new `mysite` directory, and use the `ls` command to list out all the contents of that directory, you should see a series of files (`_quarto.yml`, `about.qmd`, `index.qmd`, `styles.css`) that provide the scaffolding for your website. For example:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
# print current working directory
(base) Samanthas-MacBook-Air:git samanthacsik$ pwd 
/Users/samanthacsik/git

# move into `mysite` directory
(base) Samanthas-MacBook-Air:git samanthacsik$ cd mysite/ 
(base) Samanthas-MacBook-Air:mysite samanthacsik$ 

# list out all files in the `mysite` directory
(base) Samanthas-MacBook-Air:mysite samanthacsik$ ls
_quarto.yml	_site		about.qmd   index.qmd   styles.css
```

-   Alternatively, you can use Finder (Mac) or Windows Explorer (Windows) to view your new directory and files.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("media/mysite_finder.png")
```

4.  **Preview your very basic, but functional website** straight from the command line by typing (you'll need to navigate to your project directory (e.g `mysite/`):

```{bash}
#| eval: false
quarto preview
```

-   Your site preview should open up in your browser. Quit your preview by pressing `control` + `C`

::: {.callout-important}
## Preview your website from different locations using file paths
You will need to supply the path to your website directory when previewing from a different location. For example, if my Quarto website directory is at `User/samanthacsik/git/mysite`, but I am one directory above in `User/samanthacsik/git`, I can run `quarto preview mysite`. Alternatively I could provide the full path `quarto preview User/samanthacsik/git/mysite` or relative path quarto preview `~/git/mysite`, no matter which directory I'm currently in.
:::

5.  **Initialize your project as a git repository.** At this point you've created a directory (folder) containing some important website scaffolding files, but they're not yet being tracked by Git. First be sure to `cd` into your website folder. Then, initialize this folder as a git repository using the `git init` command in the terminal window.

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git init
```

::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
## What is a git repository?
When we initialize our R project, `mysite/` (or `username.github.io/`), as a git repository using `git init`, a hidden `.git/` folder is created *within* that project folder. This hidden `.git/` folder *is* the git repository. As you use git commands (or RStudio's GUI buttons) to capture versions or "snapshots" of your work, those versions (and their associated metadata) get stored within the `.git/` folder. This allows you to access and/or recover any previous versions of your work. If you delete `.git/`, you delete your project's history. Here is an example website repository, represented visually:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("media/git-repo-ex.png")
```

<!-- ::: {.column-margin} -->
<!-- `git status` is a super useful command which displays the state of your working directory and staging area. I use this command *often* when working on the command line to double check that I'm actually where I think I am, and to see tracked files and untracked or changed files. It's a good habit run `git status` after switching branches or before/after adding files to commit. -->
<!-- ::: -->

6.  **Check the name of your default branch** -- that is, the branch that all changes eventually get merged back into (if you're building a website, this branch is typically the one you'll want to deploy). Run `git status` in the command line to identify the name of your default branch (this should be the only branch you have at the moment). Running `git status` will return something that looks like this, where the first line tells you which branch you're currently on:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
(base) Samanthas-MacBook-Air:mysite samanthacsik$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
	.quarto/
	_quarto.yml
	_site/
	about.qmd
	index.qmd
	styles.css

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)
```

<!-- -   **If your current branch is named `master`, follow step 7 below to update the name to `main`.** Why? The racist "master" terminology for git branches motivates us to update our default branch to "main" instead. If your branch is already named `main`, you can head straight to step 8. -->

<!-- ::: {.callout-note} -->
<!-- If you create a repo in *GitHub first*, the default now has been updated to make the default branch `main`.

<!-- ::: -->

7.  **If your default branch is named `master`, update the name to `main`.** If your default branch (you should only have one branch so far, the default branch) is already named `main`, you can head straight to step 8. Otherwise, choose your workflow below based on your Git version (check your version by running `git --version` in the command line):

::: panel-tabset
## **{{< fa brands git-alt title="GitHub branch symbol" >}} For Git version 2.28 or later**

You can update the default branch to `main` by running the following line in the command line:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git config --global init.defaultBranch main
```

***This sets the default branch name to `main` for any new repositories you create moving forward (it does not rename branches in existing projects).***

You can double check that this worked by typing out the `git status` command again. The first printed line should now read, `On branch main`.

<!-- ::: {.callout-important} -->
<!-- Be mindful that your workflow for updating `master` to `main` will look different if you've already created both a local git repo (first) AND an upstream remote i.e. GitHub repo (second).

<!-- ::: -->

## **{{< fa brands git-alt title="GitHub branch symbol" >}} For older versions of Git**

Rename the default branch as `main` by running the following line in the command line:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git branch -m master main
```

The `-m` attribute is used to rename the branch without affecting the branch's history.

***This sets the default branch name to `main` ONLY for this repository (so you'll need to do this with any new local git repositories that you create.***

You can double check that this worked by typing out the `git status` command again. The first printed line should now read, `On branch main`.

## Why are we doing this?

The racist “master” terminology for git branches motivates us to update our default branch to “main” instead.

There is a push across platforms and software to update this historical default branch name from `master` to `main`. GitHub has already done so –  creating a remote repository *first* results in a default branch named `main`. Depending on your version of Git and/or your configuration settings, however, you may need to set update the name manually when creating a local git repository first (as we’re doing here).
:::

8.  **Stage/add all of your website's scaffolding files** (*analogous to checking the boxes next to your files in RStudio's Git tab*)...

```{bash}
#| eval: false
# this adds all untracked or changed files at once
git add . 

# alternatively, you can add files individually
git add <file_name>
```

::: {.callout-tip}
Use the `git status` command again to see if your files have been successfully added *before* committing them -- any untracked or changed files that were once printed in **red** should now appear in **green**.
:::

**...and commit them** (*analogous to pressing the "Commit" button in RStudio and typing your commit message into the dialog box that appears*):

```{bash}
#| eval: false
git commit -m "initial commit"
```

9.  **Create an empty remote repository on GitHub.** At this point, we've created a local git repository that contains the basic files needed to build our Quarto website. Now, we need to create a "remote" repository (i.e. a version of your project that is hosted on the internet) on GitHub. There are multiple ways to do this, but we'll cover the workflow that makes most intuitive sense to me. **Login to [GitHub](https://github.com/), [create a new repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/creating-a-new-repository), and give it the same name as your local repository/R Project (e.g. `username.github.io`).**

::: {.callout-important}
## Do not initialize your remote repository (on GitHub) with a `README.md`, license, or `.gitignore` file!

Doing so now can lead to merge conflicts. We can add them after our local and remote repositories have been connected.

## Understanding the difference between Git vs. Github 
[*Git*](https://git-scm.com/) is a **version control software** designed to manage the versioning and tracking of source code files and project history. It **operates locally** on your computer, allowing you to create repositories and track changes. It works directly with files on your computer, and is primarily used through a command line interface (e.g. Terminal, Git Bash). Some GUIs (Graphical User Interfaces), like RStudio, provide user-friendly buttons to execute git commands as well.

[*GitHub*](https://github.com/) is a **cloud-based** hosting service that allows you to **manage Git repositories** -- as Jenny Bryan describes in her book [Happy Git and GitHub for the useR](https://happygitwithr.com/index.html), hosting services like GitHub *"provide a home for your Git-based projects on the internet."* GitHub provides us with the tools for storing, managing, and collaborating on git repositories. It also offers additional features on top of Git, like issue tracking, project management tools, code review, pull requests, and more.

The illustration below depicts how we use Git and GitHub together to version control our work locally (e.g. on our computer(s)), and send versions to and receive updates from a remote (i.e. GitHub) repository.

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
#| fig-cap: "Illustration by [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.com/)"
#| fig-alt: "A basic git workflow represented as two islands, one with \"local repo\" and \"working directory\", and another with \"remote repo.\" Bunnies move file boxes from the working directory to the staging area, then with Commit move them to the local repo. Bunnies in rowboats move changes from the local repo to the remote repo (labeled \"PUSH\") and from the remote repo to the working directory (labeled \"PULL\")."
knitr::include_graphics("media/ahorst-git-workflow.png")
```
:::

10. **Connect your remote (GitHub) repository to your local git repository.** Your empty GitHub repo conveniently includes instructions for doing so. Copy the code under "push an existing repository from the command line" to your clipboard, paste into the command line, and run.

```{r}
#| echo: false
knitr::include_graphics("media/GH_quick_setup_options.png")
```

::: {.callout-note collapse=true}
## The code that GitHub provides (as shown above) should look something like this:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
git remote add origin https://github.com/yourUserName/yourRepoName.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

It does three things:

-  Adds the GitHub repository as the remote repository (i.e. connects your local repo to the remote repo)
-  Renames the default branch to `main` (if you didn't complete step 7, this will take care of it for you!)
-  Pushes the `main` branch to the remote GitHub repository
:::
<!-- 11. In Terminal, add the URL for the remote repository where your local repository will be pushed: -->

<!-- ```{bash} -->
<!-- #| eval: false -->
<!-- # set the new remote using your GitHub repo URL -->
<!-- git remote add origin <REMOTE_URL> -->

<!-- # verify the new remote URL is correct (this just prints out the URL you added) -->
<!-- git remote -v -->
<!-- ``` -->

<!-- 12. Push the changes in your local repository to your remote repository on GitHub: -->

<!-- ```{bash} -->
<!-- #| eval: false -->
<!-- git push -u origin main -->
<!-- ``` -->

You should see something similar to this print out, if successful!

```{bash}
#| eval: false
(base) Samanthas-Air:mysite samanthacsik$ git remote add origin https://github.com/samanthacsik/mysite.git
(base) Samanthas-Air:mysite samanthacsik$ git branch -M main

11. **Refresh your GitHub repository (in your web browser)** to see that your updates have been successfully pushed!

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("media/mysite-remote-cli.png")
```

12. **(Optional) Add `.gitignore`, `LICENSE`, `README.md` files, which we chose not to initialize our remote repository with**. The `touch` command can be used to create any file type that we want (just make sure you're in the desired location -- typically, you want to create these in your project's root directory). For example:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
touch .gitignore
```
