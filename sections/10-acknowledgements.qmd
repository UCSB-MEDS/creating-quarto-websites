## {{< fa people-carry-box title="Two people lift a large box together" >}} Acknowledgements {#acknowledgements}

Lots of wonderful content and tips included here were borrowed / adapted from [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.github.io/){target="_blank"}'s workshop, [Getting started with `distill` sites](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0SZiVvp32UTJ9sK_yVjI8ou6pVdFRXsY2236tiTA1c/edit){target="_blank"} -- check it out if you're looking to go the `{distill}` route! Many thanks to [Jim Gardner](https://github.com/jimgar/jimgar){target="_blank"}, who provided super helpful feedback on the flexibility of Quarto's command line tools. Grateful for [Jenny Bryan](https://github.com/jennybc){target="_blank"}, who helped with a finicky project-hood workaround for using `{usethis}` inside Quarto projects. And of course, much gratitude for all those who've shared these materials with colleagues, online, etc. -- it's been amazing to receive so many shout outs as folks share their fresh new Quarto sites {{< fa face-smile-beam title="a smiling face" >}}.
