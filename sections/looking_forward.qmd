## `r fontawesome::fa("forward", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` Looking forward

You should now have a basic version of your website up and running ðŸŽ‰ During Fall quarter, we'll learn how to:

a\. add a blog and blog posts to our websites 

b\. create custom themes

c\. continue developing your online "brand"

In the meantime, explore some [alumni websites](https://ucsb-meds.github.io/student_websites.html) (last year's students used the [`{distill}`](https://rstudio.github.io/distill/website.html) package to build their websites) for inspiration, or dig into the [Quarto Website documentation](https://quarto.org/docs/websites/) if you're hoping to get started now on further customization.
