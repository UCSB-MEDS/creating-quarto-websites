I've learned a lot about Quarto over the past year+, and I continue to discover new things on the regular! If you have suggestions on how to correct, improve, or expand on these instructions, please feel free to [file an issue on `r fontawesome::fa("github", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")` GitHub](https://github.com/UCSB-MEDS/creating-quarto-websites/issues/new). Alternatively, you may fork this repository, make any suggested changes, and submit a pull request -- if you'd like to go this route, I ask that you first open an issue to discuss your ideas with me `r fontawesome::fa("face-smile", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")`.
