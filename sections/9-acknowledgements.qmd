Lots of wonderful content and tips included here were borrowed / adapted from [Allison Horst](https://allisonhorst.github.io/)'s workshop, [Getting started with `distill` sites](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1c0SZiVvp32UTJ9sK_yVjI8ou6pVdFRXsY2236tiTA1c/edit) -- check it out if you're looking to go the `{distill}` route! Many thanks to [Jim Gardner](https://github.com/jimgar/jimgar), who provided super helpful feedback on the flexibility of Quarto's command line tools. And of course, much gratitude for all those who've shared these materials with colleagues, online, etc. -- it's been amazing to receive so many shout outs as folks share their fresh new Quarto sites `r fontawesome::fa("face-smile-beam", fill = "#5A5A5A", a11y = "sem")`.
