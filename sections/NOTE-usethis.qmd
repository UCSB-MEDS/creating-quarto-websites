## `{usethis}` is an R package that facilitates interactive workflows for project creation and development
We're using the `{usethis}` workflow here because it provides a lot of really helpful tooling   (learn more in the [documentation](https://usethis.r-lib.org/){target="_blank"}), including a couple wrapper functions to execute git commands -- in other words, we'll use some familiar-feeling R functions provided by `{usethis}` to execute some Git commands, rather than running those Git commands in the Terminal.
