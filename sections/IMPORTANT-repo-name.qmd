## Name your project `YourGitHubUsername.github.io` if you plan to deploy using GitHub pages
Because we'll be using GitHub pages to publish / host our websites, it's recommended that you name your project `YourGitHubUsername.github.io` (you're allowed **one** user website with the **github.io** suffix) -- for example, [the project / GitHub repository](https://github.com/samanthacsik/samanthacsik.github.io){target="_blank"}, which contains the code for [my personal website](https://samanthacsik.github.io/){target="_blank"}, is named `samanthacsik.github.io`. Otherwise, name it something reasonable (this will become the [slug](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Slug){target="_blank"} for your site if publishing with GitHub pages, so choose carefully). I'm calling my project **mysite** *just for tutorial purposes only* -- you should definitely give yours a more practical / creative name.
