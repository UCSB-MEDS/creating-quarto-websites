## Create a Quarto website inside an existing GitHub repository

The above instructions follow the **"create local R project (and initialize as a git repo) *first* > create upstream remote repo (on GitHub) *second*"** workflow. However, if you already have a remote GitHub repository that you want to use for your website, clone the GitHub repo, then run the following command in the command line:

```{bash}
#| eval: false
quarto create-project --type website
```

This adds the the default files (`_quarto.yml`, `.gitignore`, `index.qmd`, `about.qmd`, `styles.css`) for getting started on your website.

You may also use this approach if you already have an existing local directory of documents or R project that you'd like to use as the directory for your website. First, navigate to that directory/open that R project, then run the above command in the command line.
