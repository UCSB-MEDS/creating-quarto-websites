## What is a git repository?
When we initialize our R project, `mysite/` (or `yourGitHubUsername.github.io/`), as a git repository using `git init`, a hidden `.git/` folder is created *within* that project folder. This hidden `.git/` folder *is* the git repository. As you use git commands (or RStudio's GUI buttons) to capture versions or "snapshots" of your work, those versions (and their associated metadata) get stored within the `.git/` folder. This allows you to access and / or recover any previous versions of your work. If you delete `.git/`, you delete your project's history. Here is an example website repository, represented visually:

```{r}
#| eval: true
#| echo: false
#| fig-align: "center"
#| out-width: "100%"
knitr::include_graphics("media/git-repo-ex.png")
```
