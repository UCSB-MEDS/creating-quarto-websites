## The code that GitHub provides (as shown above) should look something like this:

```{bash filename="Command Line"}
#| eval: false
#| echo: true
git remote add origin https://github.com/YourGitHubUsername/yourRepoName.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

It does three things:

-  Adds the GitHub repository as the remote repository (i.e. connects your local repo to the remote repo)
-  Renames the default branch to `main` (if you didn't complete step 7, this will take care of it for you!)
-  Pushes the `main` branch to the remote GitHub repository
